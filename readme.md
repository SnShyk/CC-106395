# java is a compiler or interpreter? #

* #### java is both compiled and interpreted language.Its first we compiled the code into bytecode  
(bytcode is the  instruction set program code that compile the code into low level software int)
then convert into machine code by interpreter .java run environemnt can understand jvr(convert the bytecode into machine language)
thats the reason jave use both compiler and interpreter  language 

* #### java solve the platform issue , it rearrange the complier  link sequance at an root level of the compiler
he Java compiler doesn't create an object file, but instead it creates
 a bytecode file which is, essentially, an object file for a virtual machine
