# java is a compiler or interpreter? #

## Java does both compilation and interpretation ## 
In Java, programs are not compiled into executable files; they are compiled into bytecode (as discussed earlier), which the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) then interprets / executes at runtime. Java source code is compiled into bytecode when we use the javac compiler




* #### java is both compiled and interpreted language.Its first we compiled the code into bytecode  
(bytcode is the  instruction set program code that compile the code into low level software int)
then convert into machine code by interpreter .java run environemnt can understand jvr(convert the bytecode into machine language)
thats the reason jave use both compiler and interpreter  language 

* #### java solve the platform issue , it rearrange the complier  link sequance at an root level of the compiler
he Java compiler doesn't create an object file, but instead it creates
 a bytecode file which is, essentially, an object file for a virtual machine
